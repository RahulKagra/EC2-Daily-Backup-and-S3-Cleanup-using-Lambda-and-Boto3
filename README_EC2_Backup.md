## üìÅ Project Components

### ‚úÖ 1. Lambda Function
- **Function Name:** `EC2DailyBackupFunctionRahulk`
- **Region:** `us-west-2`
- **Status:** Successfully tested and deployed.
- **Purpose:** Executes daily to backup specified EC2 instance files to S3.
- **Test Result:** ‚úÖ *Execution succeeded* (`logs available in CloudWatch`)

### ‚úÖ 2. IAM Roles
#### A. `LambdaEC2BackupRoleRahulk`
- **Attached Policies:**
  - `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`
  - `AmazonS3FullAccess`
  - `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`
- **Purpose:** Assigned to Lambda to allow EC2 metadata access, upload to S3, and log to CloudWatch.

#### B. `EC2SSMAccessRoleRahuk`
- **Attached Policy:** `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore`
- **Instance Profile:** Attached to EC2 instance for SSM access.

#### C. `EC2AutoTagLambdaRoleRahulk`
- **Attached Policies:**
  - `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
  - `LambdaSSMBackupAccess` (custom)
- **Purpose:** Supports automated EC2 tagging and SSM access.
